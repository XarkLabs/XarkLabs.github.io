## XarkLabs is an outlet for Xark's projects

Hi, I'm Xark!

I've been quite lucky to have been an OG game developer (from 1981 to 2023) developing for a bunch of classic computers and video game consoles.

I was first hired to write video games (for the Atari 2600) when I was only 17.  I got a call out of the blue, asking if I would write video games for this company full time.  I had no car, but they offered to pick me up and drop me off each day, so of course I said "yes".

Being in the game industry for so long has been a totally amazing journey.  Now, after 42 years of full time game development I have retired to focus on retro, neo-retro and FPGA projects (along with other pursuits).

I hope to share some highlights and knowledge on [XarkLabs.com](http://XarkLabs.com) and on [XarkLabs YouTube channel](http://youtube.com/@XarkLabs) (content coming soon [*yikes...*]).
