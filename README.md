## XarkLabs is an outlet for Xark's projects

Hi, I'm Xark!

I've been quite lucky to have been an OG game developer (from 1981 to 2023) on a bunch of classic computers and game consoles.

Now, after 42 years of full time game development I have retired to focus on retro, neo-retro and FPGA projects (and other pursuits).

I was first hired when I was only 17 (I got a call out of the blue, and had no car) and it has been a totally amazing journey.

I hope to share some highlights here and on [XarkLabs YouTube channel](http://youtube.com/@XarkLabs) (content coming soon [*yikes...*]).
