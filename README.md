## XarkLabs is an outlet for Xark's projects

Hi, I'm Xark (aka Ken Jordan), welcome to [XarkLabs](http://XarkLabs.com)! ðŸ§ª

I feel I've been quite lucky to have been an OG game developer (from 1981 to 2023) developing for a bunch of classic computers and video game consoles.

I was first hired to write video games when I was only 17 (initially for the Atari 2600).  I got the call out of the blue, and they asked if I would write video games for their company full time (for $10 an hour vs $3.35 minimum wage).  I had no car, but they also offered to pick me up and drop me off each day - so of course I said "yes" (and then I told my parents...).

Being in the game industry for so long has been a totally amazing journey.  Now, after 42 years of full time game development I have retired to focus on retro, neo-retro and FPGA projects (along with other pursuits).

I plan on sharing some stories, knowledge and my projects on [XarkLabs YouTube channel](http://youtube.com/@XarkLabs), check it out.
